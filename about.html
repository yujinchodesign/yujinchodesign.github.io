                    <h1>Hi, I'm Yujin!</h1>
                    <p>Product design blends my passions for learning about peopleâ€™s unique experiences, creating order out of chaos, and visual thinking. I love working with dedicated people to solve interesting and meaningful problems, and I find it thrilling to constantly have my thoughts challenged throughout the design process.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently designing experiences that help small businesses grow at <a href='plastiq.com'>Plastiq</a>. Before Plastiq, I interned at SAP Concur and graduated with degrees in human-centered design and economics from the University of Washington.</p>
