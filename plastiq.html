                    <h3>What’s a TIN?</h3>
                    <p>A TIN is an umbrella term for several <span>identifiers that an entity may use for tax-reporting purposes</span>. A business may use an employer identification number (EIN), social security number (SSN), or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) as their TIN.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>When Texas cited us under 31 CFR § 1010.410 for failure to collect TINs in 2017, we quickly addressed the issue by using a third party service that would automatically retrieve the required information. Given the chance to reimagine this solution with the launch of our business app, we decided to take a more transparent approach and <span>ask businesses to provide their TINs</span>.</p>

                    <h3>How can we minimize inconvenience?</h3>

                    <p>I ran several tests on <a href='usertesting.com' target='_blank'>usertesting.com</a> to account for any oversights and answer the following research questions:</p>

                        <li>How do users react when they are asked for a TIN after adding a card?</li>
                        <li>Do users understand why we’re asking for a TIN? What unanswered questions do they have?</li>
                        <li>Do users understand how to add a TIN if they skip it in card addition?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Testing helped uncover important insights about the language used: despite being technically accurate, <span>using the acronym “TIN” along with “EIN” and “SSN” was confusing to users</span>. I opted to use “Tax ID” instead of “TIN” to add clarity. Multiple users also expressed that they were <span>wary to provide their personal information to an unfamiliar startup</span>, so I added information about our data encryption.</p>

                    <p class='space'>This project reinforced the <span>importance of making a continuous effort to uncover gaps in knowledge throughout the design process</span>. We started off the project with the understanding that we needed to collect just EINs (one type of TIN), but as I gathered feedback and conducted further research on the law, we realized that this was only part of the story. It took several discussions and research sessions to form an accurate picture of what information we needed to collect and how it should be collected.</p>
                    <p>Plastiq's business application is planned to <span>launch in January 2020</span>.</p>

                    <p>In the registration flow, our highest drop-off occurs at email confirmation. We decided to conduct an experiment <span>moving email confirmation in-app to reduce friction</span> in registration and increase user acquisition.</p>

                    <h3>"We need new users, now"</h3>
                    <p class='space'>This project emerged during a high-pressure period where we were <span>focused on acquiring new users <i>quickly</i></span>. Our Head of Operations suggested that we try improving user acquisition by modifying the registration flow, so I audited and gathered data on the flow to identify areas for improvement.</p>
                    <p>I identified an assortment of UX issues (e.g., confusing copy, unfamiliar UI patterns, long loading times) but funnel data suggested that addressing these “cosmetic” issues wouldn’t result in big wins. After further investigation and consideration of Plastiq’s immediate needs, <span>I proposed an experimentation plan where we start by addressing the highest drop-off point—30% at email confirmation</span>—and subsequently address other issues in the flow.</p>

                    <h3>Putting in the right blocks</h3>
                    <p>A verified email is key to unlocking the bulk of our app’s core functionality to mitigate the risk for illegitimate payments. We anticipated that many users might verify their email shortly after registration (based on our personal tendencies), but those that didn’t needed to be <span>blocked from adding cards and submitting payments</span>.</p>

                    <h3>1st approach: Let users access as much as possible</h3>
                    <p>My first instinct was to <span>give users as much access as we could provide</span>. If we could do a good job educating users on these blocks and the steps to remove them, users could build trust exploring the app and move forward when they were ready.</p>

                    <p>I received the feedback that <span>users might be taken aback if they were blocked at the end of a flow (on payment review)</span>.

                    <p>I decided to <span>move the block to the end of the recipient addition flow</span> (users must add a recipient before they are able to make a payment). This would allow users to complete one of the core flows in the app before being blocked from further activity.</p>

                    <p>When I tested again, I found that <span>people were much more forgiving with the block</span>. Users still expressed some surprise when they saw the block, but they were far more understanding about the necessary next steps.</p>

                    <p>A key learning that I had from this project was that <span>products often need to be designed for the emotional reactions of people versus the rational</span>. I was initially skeptical of the feedback that users would drop-off on payment review because I had too much faith in the rationality and attention spans of users.</p>

                    <p>I joined Plastiq when the company had just pivoted from consumer to small and midsize business (SMB) users.

                    <p class='space'><span>I recruited and interviewed 20 people that fit our target profile</span> (e.g., SMB owners, partners, accountants). I used <a href=‘https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory’>grounded theory research methods</a> to identify themes in the data; in retrospect this wasn't the best approach given my short timeline and research purposes, but it helped me get very close to the data and uncover nuanced topics.</p>
