                    <p class='metadata'>Plastiq Business App &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2 Weeks</p>
                    <p>Federal law requires Plastiq to record taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) of businesses that make payments greater or equal to $3000 with Texas-based cards. I was responsible for designing the TIN collection experience in Plastiq’s business app.</p>

                    <h3>The deal with TINs</h3>
                    <p>A TIN is an umbrella term for several identifiers that an entity may use for tax-reporting purposes. A business may use an employer identification number (EIN), social security number (SSN), or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) as their TIN.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>When Texas cited us under <a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1010.410' target='_blank'>31 CFR § 1010.410</a> for failure to collect TINs in 2017, we quickly addressed the issue by using a third party service that would automatically retrieve the required information. Given the chance to reimagine this solution with the launch of our business app, we decided to take a more transparent approach and ask businesses to provide their TINs.</p>
                    <div class='spacer-l'></div>
                    <h3>How can we minimize inconvenience?</h3>
                    <p>I spoke to various people at the company with knowledge on the cultural context of TINs to understand how I could minimize the inconvenience of providing TINs.</p>

                    <div class='spacer-l'></div>
                    <h3>When's the best time to ask?</h3>
                    <p>I used my learnings to identify and evaluate areas of the app where we could collect TINs. This helped guide my prototyping.</p>

                <div class='text-block'>
                    <p>After getting feedback and exploring initial concepts, I settled on an approach where users would first be educated about the TIN requirement when they added a Texas card, but given the flexibility to add their TIN until they wanted to use the card for a payment.</p>

                    <h3>Testing & Refinement</h3>
                    <p>I ran several tests on <a href='usertesting.com' target='_blank'>usertesting.com</a> to account for any oversights and answer the following research questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>How do users react when they are asked for a TIN after adding a card?</i></li>
                        <li><i>Do users understand why we’re asking for a TIN? What unanswered questions do they have?</i></li>
                        <li><i>Do users understand how to add a TIN if they skip it in card addition?</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Testing helped uncover important insights about the language used: despite being technically accurate, using the acronym “TIN” along with “EIN” and “SSN” was confusing to users. I opted to use “Tax ID” instead of “TIN” to add clarity. Multiple users also expressed that they were wary to provide their personal information to an unfamiliar startup, so I added information about our data encryption.</p>

                    <h2>Improving User Acquisition</h2>
                    <p class='metadata'>Plastiq Consumer App ∙ 2 weeks</p>
                    <p>In the registration flow, our highest drop-off occurs at email confirmation. We decided to conduct an experiment moving email confirmation in-app to reduce friction in registration and increase user acquisition.</p>
                    <div class='spacer-m'></div>
                    <h3>"We need new users, now"</h3>
                    <p>This project emerged during a high-pressure period where we were focused on acquiring new users <i>quickly</i>. Our Head of Operations suggested that we try improving user acquisition by modifying the registration flow, so I audited and gathered data on the flow to identify areas for improvement.</p>
                    <p>I identified an assortment of UX issues (e.g., confusing copy, unfamiliar UI patterns, long loading times) but funnel data suggested that addressing these “cosmetic” issues wouldn’t result in big wins. After further investigation and consideration of Plastiq’s immediate needs, I proposed an experimentation plan where we start by addressing the highest drop-off point—30% at email confirmation—and subsequently address other issues in the flow.</p>

                    <h3>Putting in the right blocks</h3>
                    <p>A verified email is key to unlocking the bulk of our app’s core functionality to mitigate the risk for illegitimate payments. We anticipated that many users might verify their email shortly after registration (based on our personal tendencies), but users that didn’t needed to be blocked from adding cards and submitting payments.</p>

                <div class='text-block'>
                    <h3>1st approach: Let users access as much as possible</h3>
                    <p>My first instinct was to give users as much access as we could provide. If we could do a good job educating users on these blocks and the steps to remove them, users could build trust exploring the app and move forward when they were ready.</p>
                    <p>[Left: static image of home screen with confirm banner, Right: gif of payment review screen showing hover tooltips</p>
                    <p>I received the feedback that users might be taken aback if they are given access to all of the app and then blocked as they were about to submit the payment. I had doubts about this feedback because it seemed to go against the hypothesis (greater access —> greater investment) and I also thought this kind of reaction could be prevented with the appropriate user education.</p>
                    <div class='spacer-m'></div>
                    <h3>People don’t pay attention</h3>
                    <p>With my uncertainties, I tested the design with three coworkers. People were indeed taken aback by the block despite the education; one user initially read the notice but was still surprised by the block on payment review because their involvement in the flow had shifted their attention.</p>
                    <div class='spacer-m'></div>
                    <h3>2nd approach: Give them a taste</h3>
                    <p>I decided to move the block to the end of the recipient addition flow. This would allow users to complete one of the core flows in the app before being blocked from further activity. When I tested again, users were much more forgiving with the block.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding SMBs</h2>
                    <p class='metadata'>User Research | 2.5 months</p>
                    <p>I joined Plastiq when the company had just pivoted from consumer to small and midsize business (SMB) users. Having expressed my interest in user research, I was given the opportunity to lead a foundational user research effort on how we could best serve SMBs with the new business product.</p>
                    <p>I started by interviewing our sales, product, and customer service teams and evaluating popular SMB finance products (e.g., Quickbooks, Stripe, PayPal) to get a better sense of who we were targeting and what they valued. I also ran a “research framing” session with our product team to understand what we knew vs. what we wanted to learn.</p>

                <div class='text-block'>
                    <p>I recruited and interviewed 20 people that fit our target profile (e.g., SMB owners, partners, accountants). I used <a href=‘https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory’>grounded theory research methods</a> to identify themes in the data; in retrospect this wasn't the best approach given my short timeline and research purposes, but it helped me get very close to the data and uncover nuanced topics.</p>
                    <p>I shared my findings via a holistic report, personas, and several presentations to various teams including a lunch and learn with the entire company.</p>

                    <h2>Blocking Fraudsters</h2>
                    <p class='metadata'>Plastiq Consumer App ∙ 1.5 weeks</p>
                    <p>As a payments platform, Plastiq experiences a lot of fraud. One of the ways fraudsters take advantage of our app is by taking over user accounts and making payments with the saved cards on the accounts. We decided to mitigate this problem by requiring users to enter card security codes upon payment submission. I was the sole designer on this project.</p>

                <div class='text-block'>
                    <p>I tested two designs on <a href='usertesting.com' target='_blank'>usertesting.com</a>: one with CSC entry placed on the top left with a lighter visual styling, and one with CSC entry on the top right with a more prominent visual styling.</p>
                    <p>The left-placed CSC entry performed quite poorly: two users overlooked the CSC field, two users questioned whether or not they could change their card, and two users forgot to submit the payment. I attributed these issues to both the light visual styling and the left placement being misaligned with users’ desired order of activities (i.e., 1st reviewing, 2nd entering CSC, 3rd submitting the payment).</p>
