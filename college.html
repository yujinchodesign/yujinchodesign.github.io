                    <h3>Problem: college apps are confusing and have lots of moving parts</h3>
                    <p>Applying to college is a pain, especially so for students in low-resource communities. College apps have a lot of moving parts—from finding schools to writing essays to taking tests—and without the proper guidance and knowledge, it can be a very stressful and confusing endeavor. This project was originally inspired by my sister, who at the time was bugging me about what the FAFSA was and which standardized test she should take. We wanted to make the pursuit of higher-education accessible and pain-free as possible for anyone who wanted it.</p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <h4>Online</h4>
                    <div class='in-text img'>
                        <img src='imgs/college/online-research.png'>
                    </div>
                    <p>Researching online forums and college applicant resources, I learned the following:</p>
                    <ul class='space'>
                        <li>Students have difficulty understanding whether a school is a good fit</li>
                        <li>Students (especially in low-income communities) are ill-informed about the college application process</li>
                        <li>Guidance is scarce in low-income communities (both from parents and counselors)</li>
                        <li>Existing college guides provide overwhelming loads of unfocused information</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Secondary Research</h4>
                    <p>I conducted a literature review on how students in low-income communities apply to college. Some of the key insights I pulled from the papers I read were:</p>
                    <ul class='space'>
                        <li>Relationships among students (i.e., peers, friends) play a strong role in motivation and ability to succeed [3][4]</li>
                        <li>Communities built around college-going have the potential to build "college-going identities" within students [4]</li>
                        <li>The decision to go to college is a complex process made over a long-period of time [2][4]</li>
                        <li>Students in low-income communities may lack the cognitive bandwidth to learn and complete tasks involved with college apps [1]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Learning from recent college applicants</h4>
                    <p>I conducted semi-structured interviews with two first and second-year college students who had attended public high schools in low to middle income communities. My main research questions for these interviews were: How do students apply to colleges? How do they make decisions about colleges and application requirements? What barriers existed in the overall process?</p>
                    <div class='in-text img'>
                        <div class='row' id='bottom'>

                                <p class='label'>Interviewee 1: college freshman, attended high school in Federal Way, WA</p>
                            </div>

                    </div>
                    <p>The interviews largely confirmed what I had learned from the literature review. I also learned that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Knowledge about colleges and the application process is largely acquired through word of mouth, as opposed to active research</li>
                        <li>Time-management is a struggle</li>
                        <li>Scholarships: perception of competition can deter students from applying for them at all</li>
                        <li>Essay-writing may be the most difficult part of the application itself; applications are pretty straightforward</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h3>Refocusing the problem: building “college-going identities”</h3>
                    <p class='space'>The steps a student needs to take to apply to college is one Google search away. Siri can probably tell you when the next SAT is. I realized, you can tell a student to take the SAT and write a personal statement, but getting them to do it is actually another story. Here's a quote taken from one of the papers I read:
                        "I try to tell my friends. Some of them just don't want to hear it. They think it's [college] too difficult or expensive or not for them." [1]
                    </p>
                    <p>"Not for them." Why not? Something both of my interviewees mentioned was that it was "obvious" that they were going to apply to college. Paired with their comments about receiving information word-of-mouth and the studies I read on the importance of "social capital", I realized that applying to college is not just a problem of getting the right information, its about the mindset they have when receiving it. Guidance will only be useful if students actually want it. So, I refocused my direction to motivating students and building "college-going identities".</p>

                    <h3>Design requirements</h3>
                    <p>Based on my research insights, I defined the following goals for my design:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Facilitate communication, collaboration, and encouragement between students to help build "college-going identities"</li>
                        <li>Help students understand what is important when selecting a school</li>
                        <li>Make scholarship applicants more relatable</li>
                        <li>Help students allocate time and understand ideal timeline of events</li>

                    <h3>Ideation: building relationships & community</h3>
                    <p>I drew inspiration from social apps like Instagram and Venmo to ideate solutions that would allow students to motivate each other and facilitate relationship and community building. I used storyboards to envision how some of my ideas would play out in real life.</p>

                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <p>I conducted two think-aloud tests with my interviewees to evaluate some initial concepts.</p>
                    <div class='in-text img'>
                        <img src='imgs/college/paper.jpeg'>
                    </div>
                    <p>The paper prototype had four main features: a to do list, chat groups with in-group bots, a social feed of people completing tasks, and personalized school results. Key takeaways included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Social feed has potential to be motivating. "I think seeing this would motivate me to do the FAFSA."</li>
                        <li>Users like the all-inclusiveness of the app. "I wish I had something like this, where everything is in one place."</li>
                        <li>Users are unclear about how people are added to chat groups.</li>
                        <li>"I'm not sure what the bots would say. Tips?"</li>
                        <li>"I wish I could use this on my computer. Most of the college app stuff is done on the computer [not phone]."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These insights led me to reassess the usefulness of bots, re-think the logic behind chat groups, and further explore the social features of the app.  I also hadn't considered making the app desktop compatible, but I realized it wouldn't make sense to have users go back and forth from their desktops to phones while working on applications.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p class='space'>Approach the research phase with an open mind. Researching for the rework, I already had a sense of what problem I wanted to address and how I wanted to address it. This led me to use my research insights in the context of my half-formed solution and prevented me from seeing the true significance of my research insights. Problems are layered, and if you don't have a good idea of all of the layers its pretty hard to come up with an effective solution.</p>
                    <p class='space'>Overthinking has diminishing returns. Just test it. I overthink a lot. While ideating solutions for College Confident, I often found myself stuck on an idea thinking about why or why not it would be effective. I think it is necessary to overthink, but to an extent. When you're stuck on an idea--test it. You'll get the answers you want much quicker.</p>
