                    <h3>Problem: employees don’t care about physical security threats</h3>
                    <p>Fulfillment Centers (FCs) are susceptible to a variety of physical threats such as armed aggressor incidents, bomb threats, and workplace violence. With over 75 FCs worldwide, each employing hundreds to thousands of people, it is essential for FC employees to be well versed on how to respond and prepare for these situations to mitigate risk.</p>
                    <div class='in-text img'>
                        <img src='imgs/amazon/fc.jpg'>
                        <p class='label'>An employee working in an Amazon Fulfillment Center</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Amazon has a variety of training and campaign materials to try and educate their employees about best practices during security incidents, however the effect of these materials is largely inhibited by employees’ lack of motivation to engage with them. For example, the completion rate for one of Amazon GSO’s most essential trainings, ‘Introduction to Incident Management’, is a meager 35-40% worldwide. The problem is not that educational materials don’t exist, but rather that people don’t care enough to learn. Thus, we were posed with the question: How can we get people to care about physical security?</p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p class='space'>We started by conducting research on the Fulfillment Center work environment, employees’ relationships to security, and past and current security education initiatives. Our research questions constantly evolved as our understanding developed.</p>
                    <h4>Site Visit - What is it like to work at a Fulfillment Center?</h4>
                    <div class='in-text img'>
                        <img src='imgs/amazon/site-visit.jpeg'>
                    </div>
                    <p class='space'>Touring a local FC and interviewing the site’s manager, our team found that FCs are very noisy, employees have rigid work schedules, and the nature of employees’ work requires their full attention. If we wanted to make employees care about something, it could not interfere with their work, and the working environment would be very difficult to leverage.</p>
                    <p class='space'>We also found that there are certain areas of FCs where we might be able to grab people’s attention without being disruptive such as the TVs at the FC entrance, the computer lab, and the break room.</p>
                    <h4>Primary Research - How do employees feel about security, and what affects this feeling?</h4>

                    <p class='space'>We interviewed 6 employees (3 from GSO and 3 in FC management) about what influenced their relationships with security and how they would influence the relationships of their coworkers, among other things.</p>
                    <p>Some of the key insights we had include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>“not caring” is embedded into the daily work cycle; changing this would require a cultural shift</li>
                        <li>awareness (of trainings, security incidents) is the starting point for caring</li>
                        <li>communication is key to building awareness and emphasizing the importance of security</li>
                        <li>providing evidence of real security incidents makes people care</li>
                        <li>the break room is a kind of haven for employees and might not be the best place to intervene</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We used a survey (with 68 participants from FCs) to validate and add depth to our interview findings.</p>

                    <h3>Design Requirements</h3>
                    <p>Based on our research, we came up with the following guidelines to direct our ideation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>encourage employees to talk about security (e.g., provide talking points, lines of communication)</li>
                        <li>pair training with evidence</li>
                        <li>ensure that employees are repeatedly exposed to content</li>
                        <li>avoid interfering with work environment; can leverage computer lab, entrance, and other touch points where employees aren’t engulfed by their work</li>

                    <h3>Ideation: gamification, napkins, devices</h3>
                    <p>Using our design guidelines as a starting point, we explored a variety of ideas that might help employees become better informed of security practices. Our initial ideas included gamifying security trainings, Chipotle-style campaigns using napkins in the break room, and devices that employees could use to communicate about security incidents.</p>

                    <h3>Building awareness with incident alerts</h3>
                    <p>After numerous sessions of independent and collective brainstorming, we decided to pursue the idea of a news-like platform where past and live security incidents at FCs around the world would be broadcasted to employees. Recalling the importance of culture in shaping employees’ attitudes, we thought a platform like this could help create a more security-centric culture by fostering a constant dialogue around security and embedding security into the daily routine of FCs.</p>

                    <h3>Guerilla Testing</h3>
                    <p>Our paper prototype consisted of two main parts: a broadcast-style TV UI, and a paired mobile app. Due to initial barriers recruiting actual FC employees, we opted to test with students on campus to get some quick feedback.</p>
                    <div class='in-text img'>
                        <img src='imgs/amazon/testing-1.jpg'>
                    </div>
                    <p>Testing helped us understand that there needed to be more visual consistency between the TV and mobile UIs, we needed to better support the different cases of using a system with multiple entrypoints (e.g., what if someone opens the mobile app, having already seen content on the TV?), and that there were some usability issues that needed to be addressed.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Some of the insights we made during this round of testing included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>managers are worried about broadcasts containing sensitive information</li>
                        <li>will there be enough content for the platform?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As a result of these findings, we envisioned a pipeline where any sensitive information would be redacted from incident reports before they were inputted to the system and we came up with a logic for repurposing historical incidents as content.</p>

                    <h3>Final Design: Amazon Alert</h3>
                    <p class='space'>Amazon Alert is a digital system (consisting of a desktop app and mobile app) that strives to create a safer workplace at Fulfillment Centers by building strong security cultures.</p>
                    <p>The system builds awareness by bringing security events to light, fosters discussions about security, and provides training information to employees when it matters to them the most. All of these things collectively help make FCs more security-centric, and ultimately a safer place to work.</p>

                <div class='text-content'>
                    <h4>A paired system</h4>
                    <p class='space'>The system consists of two overarching parts: a mobile app and a desktop app. The core feature of the desktop app is the Screensaver: an unending stream of Incident Reports, Comments, and Trainings that gets broadcasted on available screens in the FC. The mobile app allows employees to interact with content, cultivating their knowledge and personal involvement with security.</p>

                    <h4>Learning from security events around the world</h4>
                    <p>The core of Amazon Alerts is Incident Reports: reports of live and historical security incidents (e.g., bomb threats, workplace violence, etc.) that occur at Fulfillment Centers all over the world. Learning about real events helps people understand why security training is important and can be kindling for discussions about security, which are further encouraged by a Comments section on each Incident Report.</p>

                    <h4>Training when it matters</h4>
                    <p>Every Incident Report is paired with relevant Trainings so people can get their questions answered when they have them. Instead of going through long compounded trainings, users can learn in bite-size experiences when they have a personal interest in learning.</p>

                    <h4>Private and Public Account Types for use throughout FCs</h4>
                    <p>Amazon Alert is intended to be used on a variety of screens throughout FCs: the public-facing computers that make up the computer lab, the announcement monitors at the entrance of FCs, and employees’ work computers. To allow for features such as bookmarking and commenting on Incident Reports and Trainings, Amazon Alert has both Private and Public account types.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p class='space'>One of my key learnings from this project was how difficult it is to test changes in mindset. The goal of Amazon Alert is to build culture, but culture is something that happens over time and is not necessarily visible. We made the best out of the time and resources we were given, but the results of our testing didn’t really provide any validation on whether this solution would work in the long-term. </p>
                    <p>I think a better way of testing may have been doing pre- and post- test surveys that asked questions about employees’ sentiments towards trainings and security threats, keeping participants blind from what the goals of the system were. If, for example, and employee felt that they thought training was more important after interacting with the system, we could assume that change was attributed to our system.</p>
